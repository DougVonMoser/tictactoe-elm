i have an array of stuff
i need to translate that to a view
if my div has an array in it what happens
div [] []
thats the fucking array!!! okay


i want it to be
div [] [
    div [] ["x", "x", "x"]
    , div [] ["o", "x", "o"]
    , div [] ["x", "x", "x"]
]

now i need each Blank element to be able to give me its location??
location? 
can each element own its state??
no. youd want all the state in the state. 
can each blanco have its own submodel
