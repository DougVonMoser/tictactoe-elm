i have an array of stuff
i need to translate that to a view
if my div has an array in it what happens
div [] []
thats the fucking array!!! okay


i want it to be
div [] [
    div [] ["x", "x", "x"]
    , div [] ["o", "x", "o"]
    , div [] ["x", "x", "x"]
]

now i need each Blank element to be able to give me its location??
location? 
can each element own its state??
no. youd want all the state in the state. 
can each blanco have its own submodel?  not sure i want that

i want to pass a winner state to the actual cell

also checkWinner has to return more than a bool. 
    i need to tom petty:
        - did x win?
        - did O win?
        - which cells?

for now though, bool works and throw it in a span

X - O
X - O
X - O

flatten the board array

get all x indeces first, check against the winning combos -> XWon
then get y indeces, check them against winning combos -> OWon
else if full board? -> Cats
else -> Playing

ahhh there will be more than 3 ints
